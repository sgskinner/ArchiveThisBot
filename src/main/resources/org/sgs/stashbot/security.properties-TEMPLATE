# This file is an example security.properties that org.sgs.stashbot.spring.StashThisConfiguration
# pulls sensitve properties from. This repo's gitignore file has an entry for security.properties;
# this is to try and prevent a security leak from happening (e.g., accidentally committing credentials).
# this is to prevent accidental checking of sensitive info.
#
# Directions for use:
#
# First, copy this file to:
# src/main/resources/org/sgs/stashbot/security.properties
# (i.e., the same dir as this file)
#
# Next, replace all occurences of 'CHANGEME' to real values, and that's it. The Spring framework
# will autowire these properties into the appropriate locations at runtime.
